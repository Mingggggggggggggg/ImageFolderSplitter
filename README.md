# ImageFolderSplitter
A script that enumerates images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) in folders and divides them into adjustable batch sizes. 

For Windows
Haven't and can't test for Linux or Mac.
This App is currently in german. Maybe I'll add multiple languages in the future.

## How to use
1. Download ImageFolderSplitter.py
2. Execute the file using your IDE or terminal (Make sure you have Python installed)
3. Select your desired folder
4. Set Batchsize
5. Start

## Check the sourcecode
Feel free to check the sourcecode and report any issues you may find. I am happy to learn from my mistakes


I would like to convert the python file into an .exe but auto-to-exe can't seem to import DLLs and pyinstaller just straight up does not work/install
